  <AttractionCalculationSetting_title>Attraction Calculation Mode</AttractionCalculationSetting_title>
  <AttractionCalculationSetting_desc>Change how attraction is calculated. 'Complex' is default, allows for the most sophisticated behavior, but can hurt performance. 'Simplified' is similar to 'complex' but uses simpler calculations. 'Vanilla' approximates vanilla attraction and is the least resource intensive.</AttractionCalculationSetting_desc>

  <GenderModeSetting_title>Gendered Behavior Mode</GenderModeSetting_title>
  <GenderModeSetting_desc>This setting changes how gendered behavior works in Rimworld, within the scope of this mod. For example, straight women in Vanilla rimworld are only 15% as likely as men to initiate a romance. You can choose to remove this behavior, or inverse them (so that rules that apply to women now apply to men and vice-versa). Note that this is only for those behavior related to romance.</GenderModeSetting_desc>

  <NumberOfRelationships_title>Unpenalized Relationships</NumberOfRelationships_title>
  <NumberOfRelationships_desc>Pawns with at least this number of relationships find it harder to make new ones. This is only for romantic and semi-romantic relationships. Set this arbitrarily high for a free-for-all.</NumberOfRelationships_desc>
